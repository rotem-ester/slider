# Slider

a component that allows a range of input values according to a cursor position upon a bar.  
it can have any min and max values, and initial value. the current value is displayed on the screen.  
to add a slider to the document body, use "createSlider" function and provide the required values (min, max, id suffix that will be used on all the inner components' ids of the slider, initial value)  
to run the script I have used "live server" extension of vscode.
